# 🐼 AmateurPanda.com

🚧 **Note:** This website is under construction! As such, any links to the domain `amateurpanda.com` are currently just placeholders.

This is my ([@andiemmadavies](https://www.github.com/andiemmadavies)) personal website, built as an [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) using [React](https://www.reactjs.org/) on the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework (bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://www.github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)) and written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The website will be divided into _three_ subdomains:

1. 👩 [https://**andi**.amateurpanda.com/](https://andi.amateurpanda.com/) – _my **personal profile**, portfolio, social media links, etc._
2. 🕹 [https://**gaming**.amateurpanda.com/](https://gaming.amateurpanda.com/) – _content related to my AmateurPanda92 **retro gaming** YouTube channel._
3. 🎵 [https://**music**.amateurpanda.com/](https://music.amateurpanda.com/) – _website for my **solo music project**, “Amateur Panda”._

_(There will be a **hub page** at the `www` subdomain.)_

## Development

To start developing, run `yarn dev` to launch a development server instance and open http://localhost:3000/ in a web browser to view the locally-hosted website. Hot reloading is enabled, so changes should appear as and when source files are saved.
